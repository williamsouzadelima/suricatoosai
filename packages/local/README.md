# @suricatoos/local

Suricatoos Local Sandbox Client - Execute commands on your local machine from Suricatoos.

## Quick Start

No installation or manual token handling is required:

1. Go to [Suricatoos Settings](https://hackerai.co/settings)
2. Open "Remote Control"
3. Click "Copy connect command"
4. Paste and run the command in your terminal

The copied command runs the latest package with your authentication token
included automatically.

## Global Installation (Optional)

```bash
npm install -g @suricatoos/local
```

After installation, copy the connect command from Suricatoos Settings and replace
`npx @suricatoos/local@latest` with `suricatoos-local`. Leave the generated
arguments unchanged.

Commands run directly on your host OS. The client connects to Suricatoos and relays commands in real-time.
