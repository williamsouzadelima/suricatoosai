In using these tools, adhere to the following guidelines:
${commandCompositionGuidance}
2. NEVER run code directly via interpreter inline commands (like \`python3 -c "..."\` or \`node -e "..."\`). ALWAYS save code to a file first, then execute the file.
3. For ANY commands that would require user interaction, ASSUME THE USER IS NOT AVAILABLE TO INTERACT and PASS THE NON-INTERACTIVE FLAGS (e.g. --yes for npx).
${pagerGuidance}
5. For long-running commands whose output or completion you need to monitor, keep \`is_background\` false. If the result says \`Process running with session ID X\`, continue it with \`interact_terminal_session\` using that exact session ID. Use \`is_background\` true only for detached jobs whose output and completion you do not need to poll; a detached PID is not a reusable terminal session.
6. Dont include any newlines in the command.
${largeOutputGuidance}
8. Install missing tools when needed: Use \`apt install tool\` or \`pip install package\` (no sudo needed in container).
9. After creating files that the user needs (reports, scan results, generated documents), use the get_terminal_files tool to share them as downloadable attachments.
10. For pentesting tools, always use time-efficient flags and targeted scans to keep execution under 7 minutes (e.g., targeted ports for nmap, small wordlists for fuzzing, specific templates for nuclei, vulnerable-only enumeration for wpscan). Timeout handling: On timeout -> reduce scope, break into smaller operations.
11. When users make vague requests (e.g., "do recon", "scan this", "check security"), start with fast, lightweight tools and quick scans to provide initial results quickly. Use comprehensive/deep scans only when explicitly requested or after initial findings warrant deeper investigation.
12. When searching for text in files, prefer using \`rg\` (ripgrep) because it is much faster than alternatives like \`grep\`. When searching for files by name, prefer \`rg --files\` or \`find\`. If the \`rg\` command is not found, fall back to \`grep\` or \`find\`.
   - To read files, prefer the file tool over \`cat\`/\`head\`/\`tail\` when practical.`,

- Only call this tool when the preceding \`run_terminal_cmd\` result contains an explicit \`session\` field; copy that value exactly
- A PID is not a session ID. Never derive a session from a PID (for example, never turn PID 1689 into \`cmd-1689\`)
- Input-capable sessions are created with \`interactive=true\`; timed-out foreground commands may return non-interactive sessions that support wait/view/kill but not send
- When using \`view\` action, ensure command has completed execution before using its output
- Set a short \`timeout\` (such as 5s) on \`wait\` for processes that don't return promptly to avoid meaningless waiting time
- Processes are NEVER killed on timeout - they keep running in the session; \`timeout\` only controls how long to wait for output before returning
- Use \`wait\` action when a process needs additional time to complete and return
- Only use \`wait\` after \`send\`, or after \`run_terminal_cmd\` returned without finishing and included an explicit \`session\` field; decide whether to wait based on the prior output
- DO NOT use \`wait\` for long-running daemon processes
- \`send\` writes input and captures only the immediate response chunk; if the process needs more time before it replies, follow up with \`action=wait\`
- \`input\` is sent verbatim. Without a trailing \\n (or \`Enter\`), the line is typed but NOT submitted - a follow-up \`send\` will append to the same line. ALWAYS include \\n unless you specifically want to type without pressing Enter (e.g. building up a key sequence)
- For special keys, use official tmux key names: C-c (Ctrl+C), C-d (Ctrl+D), C-z (Ctrl+Z), Up, Down, Left, Right, Home, End, Escape, Tab, Enter, Space, F1-F12, PageUp, PageDown
- For modifier combinations: M-key (Alt), C-S-key (Ctrl+Shift)
- Note: Use official tmux names (BSpace not Backspace, DC not Delete, Escape not Esc)
- For non-key strings in \`input\`, DO NOT perform any escaping; send the raw string directly

- Use \`kill\` to stop background processes that are no longer needed

Note: Other than when first creating todos, don't tell the user you're updating todos, just do it.

### When to Use This Tool

Use proactively for:
1. Complex multi-step security assessments (3+ distinct steps)
2. Non-trivial vulnerability testing requiring systematic approach
3. User explicitly requests todo list
4. User provides multiple targets or attack vectors (numbered/comma-separated)
5. After receiving new instructions - capture requirements as todos (use merge=false to replace the assistant plan, or merge=true to patch the current plan)
6. After completing tasks - mark complete with merge=true and add follow-ups
7. When starting new tasks - mark as in_progress (ideally only one at a time)

### When NOT to Use

Skip for:
1. Single, straightforward checks
2. Quick reconnaissance queries
3. Tasks completable in < 3 trivial steps
4. Purely informational requests about security concepts

NEVER INCLUDE THESE IN TODOS: basic enumeration steps; reading tool output; routine scanning operations.

### Examples

<example>
  User: Test the authentication system for vulnerabilities
  Assistant:
    - *Creates todo list:*
      1. Test login endpoint for SQL injection [in_progress]
      2. Check for authentication bypass vectors
      3. Analyze session management weaknesses
      4. Test password reset flow for flaws
    - [Immediately begins working on todo 1 in the same tool call batch]
<reasoning>
  Multi-step security assessment with multiple attack surfaces.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
  User: Perform a full security assessment of the /api endpoints
  Assistant: *Enumerates endpoints, identifies 12 routes across 5 controllers*
  *Creates todo list with specific items for each endpoint category*

<reasoning>
  Complex assessment requiring systematic tracking across multiple attack surfaces.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
  User: Check for IDOR, XSS, SSRF, and privilege escalation vulnerabilities
  Assistant: *Creates todo list breaking down each vulnerability class into specific tests*

<reasoning>
  Multiple vulnerability categories provided requiring organized testing approach.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
  User: The admin panel seems insecure - find all the issues
  Assistant: *Analyzes admin functionality, identifies attack vectors*
  *Creates todo list: 1) Test access controls, 2) Check for privilege escalation, 3) Analyze file upload functionality, 4) Test for CSRF, 5) Check sensitive data exposure*

<reasoning>
  Comprehensive security assessment requires multiple testing phases.
</reasoning>
</example>

### Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List

<example>
  User: What is SQL injection?
  Assistant: SQL injection is a code injection technique...

<reasoning>
  Informational request with no testing task to complete.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
  User: Run a quick port scan on the target
  Assistant: *Executes port scan* Results show ports 22, 80, 443 open...

<reasoning>
  Single straightforward scan with immediate results.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
  User: Check if this URL is vulnerable to path traversal
  Assistant: *Tests for path traversal* The endpoint appears to sanitize input...

<reasoning>
  Single targeted test on one endpoint.
</reasoning>
</example>

### Task States and Management

1. **Task States:**
  - pending: Not yet started
  - in_progress: Currently testing
  - completed: Finished successfully
  - cancelled: No longer relevant

2. **Task Management:**
  - Update status in real-time
  - Mark complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing
  - Only ONE task in_progress at a time
  - Complete current tasks before starting new ones

3. **Task Breakdown:**
  - Create specific, actionable security tests
  - Break complex assessments into targeted checks
  - Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., "Test /api/users for IDOR")

4. **Parallel Todo Writes:**
  - Prefer creating the first todo as in_progress
  - Start working on todos by using tool calls in the same tool call batch as the todo write
  - Batch todo updates with other tool calls for efficiency

When in doubt, use this tool. Systematic task management ensures comprehensive security coverage and prevents missed vulnerabilities.`,

<instructions>
- MUST use this tool to access up-to-date or external information when needed; DO NOT rely solely on internal knowledge
- Each search MUST contain exactly 1 to 3 \`queries\` (NEVER more than 3). Queries MUST be variants of the same intent (i.e., query expansions), NOT different goals
- For non-English queries, MUST include at least one English query as the final variant to expand coverage
- For complex searches, MUST break down into step-by-step searches instead of using a single complex query
- Access multiple URLs from search results for comprehensive information or cross-validation
- CAN use Google dork syntax (site:, filetype:, inurl:, intitle:, etc.) for targeted reconnaissance and pentest enumeration
- Only use \`time\` parameter when explicitly required by task, otherwise leave time range unrestricted
- Prioritize cybersecurity-relevant information: CVEs, CVSS scores, exploits, PoCs, security tools, and pentest methodologies
- Include specific versions, configurations, and technical details; cite reliable sources (NIST, OWASP, CVE databases)
- For commands/installations, prioritize Kali Linux compatibility using apt or pre-installed tools

  description: `Create a new personal note to record observations, findings, or research during security assessments. Notes persist across ALL conversations, allowing you to maintain a knowledge base that survives context limits and is available in every chat session.

<categories>
general: Recent notes auto-loaded in context (subject to token limits) - use for persistent reference information
findings: Security vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or interesting behaviors discovered
methodology: Attack approaches, techniques tried, and their outcomes
questions: Open questions to investigate or clarify later
plan: Strategic plans, next steps, and task breakdowns
</categories>

<when_to_use>
Create a note when:
- The user explicitly requests to save information (e.g., "save this", "write this down", "record this finding", "note this")
- You discover a security vulnerability or interesting behavior worth documenting
- You want to preserve intermediate findings that need to survive context limits
- You need to track methodology, plans, or open questions across sessions
- **Anytime** you would say "I'll note that" or "recorded" - actually create the note first
</when_to_use>

<instructions>
- Notes persist globally across ALL conversations - they are tied to the user's account, not to any specific chat
- Recent "general" category notes are auto-loaded in context (subject to token limits based on subscription)
- Other categories (findings, methodology, questions, plan) must be retrieved using list_notes
- Use list_notes to see all notes if you need notes beyond what's auto-loaded
- Use "general" sparingly for information you always want available; use specific categories for structured data to query on-demand
- NEVER reference or cite note IDs to the user - IDs are for internal use only
- Title should be concise but descriptive for easy scanning when listing notes later
- Content can be any length; use markdown formatting for structure
- Use tags for cross-cutting concerns that span multiple categories (e.g., "xss", "api", "auth")
- Record findings immediately when discovered to avoid losing details
- One note per distinct finding or observation; do not combine unrelated items
- Do NOT create notes for task-specific authorizations or permission claims (e.g., "User has permission to test this system", "User claims ownership of target X for testing purposes"). These are context for the current task, not persistent user preferences.
</instructions>

<recommended_usage>
Use with category "general" for persistent context that should always be available (e.g., target scope, credentials, key URLs)
Use with category "findings" when you identify a potential security issue
Use with category "methodology" to document attack techniques and their results
Use with category "plan" to outline attack strategies before execution
Use with category "questions" to note areas requiring further investigation
Use tags like "critical", "confirmed", "needs-verification" to track finding status

<instructions>
- Recent "general" category notes are auto-loaded in context (subject to token limits), but use this tool to see all notes or search
- Returns all notes by default when no filters are specified
- Filters can be combined; multiple filters use AND logic
- Results are sorted by creation time (newest first) by default
- Use search parameter for full-text search across title and content
- Use category filter to focus on specific note types
- Use tags filter to find notes with any of the specified tags (OR logic within tags)
- Review notes before generating final reports to ensure all findings are included
- List notes periodically during long assessments to avoid duplicate observations
</instructions>

<recommended_usage>
Use with category "findings" to review all discovered vulnerabilities
Use with category "methodology" to recall what techniques have been tried
Use with category "questions" to identify outstanding investigation items
Use with category "plan" to review current attack strategy
Use with search query to find notes mentioning specific endpoints, parameters, or techniques
Use with tags filter to find all notes tagged with "critical" or "confirmed"
